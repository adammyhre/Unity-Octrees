Octrees in Unity offer an efficient way to optimize large 3D spaces, and in this video, we dive into implementing an Octree and using it in combination with the A* algorithm for pathfinding. We'll show how Octrees help divide space to manage objects and obstacles, making A* pathfinding more efficient in complex 3D environments. Youâ€™ll learn how to avoid obstacles, calculate the best routes, and leverage the power of Octrees to improve performance. Whether you're building a large open world or a detailed simulation, this tutorial will help you make the most of your spatial data in Unity.
